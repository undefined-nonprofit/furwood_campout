Thank you to Shiny Dog Productions for hooking us up with the equipment we need for our play space! Shiny Dog creates experiences for the Queer and Furry communities , from pop-up events to bar nights and weekend getaways. They build spaces where you can be yourself, and we’re so lucky to have their support.

We’re also very happy to team up with FetchNW! They’re donating two tickets to one of their upcoming events, and one lucky attendee will win them! FetchNW throws some of the best parties and events in the Pacific Northwest for the furry, pup, and queer communities. Make sure to check out their next event at FetchNW.com.
