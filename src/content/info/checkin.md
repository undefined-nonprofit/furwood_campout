# Preparing for Camping

Make sure you come to camp with all the items an animal needs to live for the weekend. TRC is 10 miles away from the nearest grocery store. There is potable water, but bring water jugs since the tap is a fair walk away from camp. For the full list of items TRC recommends, see [their list of what to bring here.](https://www.camptrc.org/What-to-Bring)

There is also no cell service at TRC, so get ready to log-off and connect with your friends and community.

# Checking into Camp

1. Check-in at the Host Hut in the lower camping area (look for the flag!).
2. Unload your car (wheelbarrows are provided by TRC) to your site.
3. Move your car to the permanent parking lot, TRC does not have space at the tent sites for your car. The lower lot is pretty small and will be busy during check-in, if you need help with unloading let us know!
4. Check-in for event registration at Junkyard dogs!

**Note** - If you are bringing an RV, proceed directly to your RV spot in the upper campground (left side of road). Don't attempt to drive your RV into the lower campground (right side of road).

# While you're camping

1. TRC is clothing optional and sex-positive, but keep yourself covered while crossing the street~ consent is mandatory, gear does not equal consent.
2. TRC has strict rules about keeping food in bear-proof containers, as there has been bear activity in the past. There is a bear-proof trailer near the tent sites you must keep your food and tasty-chemicals in overnight. For more info check out their [bear info page](https://www.camptrc.org/Bear-Info). -- The only critters we want cruising through camp are the ones attending our campout :3
4. Lost? Looking for activities? Junkyard Dogs will be our basecamp!
